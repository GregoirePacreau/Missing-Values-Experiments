  abstract = {The use of intelligent systems for stock market predictions has been widely established. This paper deals with the application of hybridized soft computing techniques for automated stock market forecasting and trend analysis. We make use of a neural network for one day ahead stock forecasting and a neuro-fuzzy system for analyzing the trend of the predicted stock values. To demonstrate the proposed technique, we considered the popular Nasdaq-100 index of Nasdaq Stock MarketSM. We analyzed the 24 months stock data for Nasdaq-100 main index as well as six of the companies listed in the Nasdaq-100 index. Input data were preprocessed using principal component analysis and fed to an artificial neural network for stock forecasting. The predicted stock values are further fed to a neuro-fuzzy system to analyze the trend of the market. The forecasting and trend prediction results using the proposed hybrid system are promising and certainly warrant further research and analysis.},

  abstract = {Deep learning is at the heart of the current rise of artificial intelligence. In the field of Computer Vision, it has become the workhorse for applications ranging from self-driving cars to surveillance and security. Whereas deep neural networks have demonstrated phenomenal success (often beyond human capabilities) in solving complex problems, recent studies show that they are vulnerable to adversarial attacks in the form of subtle perturbations to inputs that lead a model to predict incorrect outputs. For images, such perturbations are often too small to be perceptible, yet they completely fool the deep learning models. Adversarial attacks pose a serious threat to the success of deep learning in practice. This fact has recently lead to a large influx of contributions in this direction. This article presents the first comprehensive survey on adversarial attacks on deep learning in Computer Vision. We review the works that design adversarial attacks, analyze the existence of such attacks and propose defenses against them. To emphasize that adversarial attacks are possible in practical conditions, we separately review the contributions that evaluate adversarial attacks in the real-world scenarios. Finally, drawing on the reviewed literature, we provide a broader outlook of this research direction.},

Traditional methods for estimating asset-return covariance operate under the assumption of statistical time-invariance, and are thus unable to appropriately infer the underlying true structure of the market graph. This work introduces a class of graph spectral estimators which cater for the nonstationarity inherent to asset price movements, and serve as a basis to represent the time-varying interactions between assets through a dynamic spectral market graph. Such an account of the time-varying nature of the asset-return covariance allows us to introduce the notion of dynamic spectral portfolio cuts, whereby the graph is partitioned into time-evolving clusters, allowing for online and robust asset allocation. The advantages of the proposed framework over traditional methods are demonstrated through numerical case studies using real-world price data.},

For networks of constant depth and with a large range of widths (for instance, it suffices if the width of each layer is polynomial in that of any other layer), small perturbations of input vectors lead to large changes of outputs. This generalizes results of Daniely and Schacham (2020) for networks of rapidly decreasing width and of Bubeck et al (2021) for two-layer networks. The proof shows that adversarial examples arise in these networks because the functions that they compute are very close to linear. Bottleneck layers in the network play a key role: the minimal width up to some point in the network determines scales and sensitivities of mappings computed up to that point. The main result is for networks with constant depth, but we also show that some constraint on depth is necessary for a result of this kind, because there are suitably deep networks that, with constant probability, compute a function that is close to constant.},

Our model takes graphs as input, performs object- and relation-centric reasoning in a way that is analogous to a simulation, and is implemented using deep neural networks. We evaluate its ability to reason about several challenging physical domains: n-body problems, rigid-body collision, and non-rigid dynamics. Our results show it can be trained to accurately simulate the physical trajectories of dozens of objects over thousands of time steps, estimate abstract quantities such as energy, and generalize automatically to systems with different numbers and configurations of objects and relations. Our interaction network implementation is the first general-purpose, learnable physics engine, and a powerful general framework for reasoning about object and relations in a wide variety of complex real-world domains.},

We propose a graph neural network implementation of the ARMA filter with a recursive and distributed formulation, obtaining a convolutional layer that is efficient to train, localized in the node space, and can be transferred to new graphs at test time. We perform a spectral analysis to study the filtering effect of the proposed ARMA layer and report experiments on four downstream tasks: semi-supervised node classification, graph signal classification, graph classification, and graph regression. Results show that the proposed ARMA layer brings significant improvements over graph neural networks based on polynomial filters.},

However, the eigendecomposition of the Laplacian is expensive and, since clustering results are graph-specific, pooling methods based on SC must perform a new optimization for each new sample. In this paper, we propose a graph clustering approach that addresses these limitations of SC. We formulate a continuous relaxation of the normalized minCUT problem and train a GNN to compute cluster assignments that minimize this objective. Our GNN-based implementation is differentiable, does not require to compute the spectral decomposition, and learns a clustering function that can be quickly evaluated on out-of-sample graphs. From the proposed clustering method, we design a graph pooling operator that overcomes some important limitations of state-of-the-art graph pooling techniques and achieves the best performance in several supervised and unsupervised tasks.},

  abstract = {The last decade has witnessed an experimental revolution in data science and machine learning, epitomised by deep learning methods. Indeed, many high-dimensional learning tasks previously thought to be beyond reach -- such as computer vision, playing Go, or protein folding -- are in fact feasible with appropriate computational scale. Remarkably, the essence of deep learning is built from two simple algorithmic principles: first, the notion of representation or feature learning, whereby adapted, often hierarchical, features capture the appropriate notion of regularity for each task, and second, learning by local gradient-descent type methods, typically implemented as backpropagation. While learning generic functions in high dimensions is a cursed estimation problem, most tasks of interest are not generic, and come with essential pre-defined regularities arising from the underlying low-dimensionality and structure of the physical world. This text is concerned with exposing these regularities through unified geometric principles that can be applied throughout a wide spectrum of applications. Such a 'geometric unification' endeavour, in the spirit of Felix Klein's Erlangen Program, serves a dual purpose: on one hand, it provides a common mathematical framework to study the most successful neural network architectures, such as CNNs, RNNs, GNNs, and Transformers. On the other hand, it gives a constructive procedure to incorporate prior physical knowledge into neural architectures and provide principled way to build future architectures yet to be invented.},

SFDs can simulate systems in stable, steady or explosive state. SFDs add Topology to the Statistical and Econometric toolkit.

We evaluate the efficacy of our approach on simple rigid body dynamics in two-dimensional worlds.

We show that these new estimators achieve the minimax rate with optimal dependence on the contamination proportion.

Such a graph-theoretic portfolio partitioning technique is shown to allow the investor to devise robust and tractable asset allocation schemes, by virtue of a rigorous graph framework for considering smaller, computationally feasible, and economically meaningful clusters of assets, based on graph cuts. In turn, this makes it possible to fully utilize the asset returns covariance matrix for constructing the portfolio, even without the requirement for its inversion. The advantages of the proposed framework over traditional methods are demonstrated through numerical simulations based on real-world price data.},

  abstract = {Algorithms to solve variational regularization of ill-posed inverse problems usually involve operators that depend on a collection of continuous parameters. When these operators enjoy some (local) regularity, these parameters can be selected using the so-called Stein Unbiased Risk Estimate (SURE). While this selection is usually performed by exhaustive search, we address in this work the problem of using the SURE to efficiently optimize for a collection of continuous parameters of the model. When considering non-smooth regularizers, such as the popular l1-norm corresponding to soft-thresholding mapping, the SURE is a discontinuous function of the parameters preventing the use of gradient descent optimization techniques. Instead, we focus on an approximation of the SURE based on finite differences as proposed in (Ramani et al., 2008). Under mild assumptions on the estimation mapping, we show that this approximation is a weakly differentiable function of the parameters and its weak gradient, coined the Stein Unbiased GrAdient estimator of the Risk (SUGAR), provides an asymptotically (with respect to the data dimension) unbiased estimate of the gradient of the risk. Moreover, in the particular case of soft-thresholding, it is proved to be also a consistent estimator. This gradient estimate can then be used as a basis to perform a quasi-Newton optimization. The computation of the SUGAR relies on the closed-form (weak) differentiation of the non-smooth function. We provide its expression for a large class of iterative methods including proximal splitting ones and apply our strategy to regularizations involving non-smooth convex structured penalties. Illustrations on various image restoration and matrix completion problems are given.},

  abstract = {Due to the fact much of today's data can be represented as graphs, there has been a demand for generalizing neural network models for graph data. One recent direction that has shown fruitful results, and therefore growing interest, is the usage of graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs). They have been shown to provide a significant improvement on a wide range of tasks in network analysis, one of which being node representation learning. The task of learning low-dimensional node representations has shown to increase performance on a plethora of other tasks from link prediction and node classification, to community detection and visualization. Simultaneously, signed networks (or graphs having both positive and negative links) have become ubiquitous with the growing popularity of social media. However, since previous GCN models have primarily focused on unsigned networks (or graphs consisting of only positive links), it is unclear how they could be applied to signed networks due to the challenges presented by negative links. The primary challenges are based on negative links having not only a different semantic meaning as compared to positive links, but their principles are inherently different and they form complex relations with positive links. Therefore we propose a dedicated and principled effort that utilizes balance theory to correctly aggregate and propagate the information across layers of a signed GCN model. We perform empirical experiments comparing our proposed signed GCN against state-of-the-art baselines for learning node representations in signed networks. More specifically, our experiments are performed on four real-world datasets for the classical link sign prediction problem that is commonly used as the benchmark for signed network embeddings algorithms.},

  abstract = {Tight estimation of the Lipschitz constant for deep neural networks (DNNs) is useful in many applications ranging from robustness certification of classifiers to stability analysis of closed-loop systems with reinforcement learning controllers. Existing methods in the literature for estimating the Lipschitz constant suffer from either lack of accuracy or poor scalability. In this paper, we present a convex optimization framework to compute guaranteed upper bounds on the Lipschitz constant of DNNs both accurately and efficiently. Our main idea is to interpret activation functions as gradients of convex potential functions. Hence, they satisfy certain properties that can be described by quadratic constraints. This particular description allows us to pose the Lipschitz constant estimation problem as a semidefinite program (SDP). The resulting SDP can be adapted to increase either the estimation accuracy (by capturing the interaction between activation functions of different layers) or scalability (by decomposition and parallel implementation). We illustrate the utility of our approach with a variety of experiments on randomly generated networks and on classifiers trained on the MNIST and Iris datasets. In particular, we experimentally demonstrate that our Lipschitz bounds are the most accurate compared to those in the literature. We also study the impact of adversarial training methods on the Lipschitz bounds of the resulting classifiers and show that our bounds can be used to efficiently provide robustness guarantees.},

Taking advantage of both worlds, a covariance matrix estimation procedure is designed on a robust (mixture of scaled Gaussian) low-rank model by leveraging the observed-data likelihood function within an expectation-maximization algorithm. It is also designed to handle general pattern of missing values. The proposed procedure is first validated on simulated data sets. Then, its interest for classification and clustering applications is assessed on two real data sets with missing values, which include multispectral and hyperspectral time series.},

  abstract = {This paper contains a new approach toward a theory of robust estimation; it treats in detail the asymptotic theory of estimating a location parameter for contaminated normal distributions, and exhibits estimators--intermediaries between sample mean and sample median--that are asymptotically most robust (in a sense to be specified) among all translation invariant estimators. For the general background, see Tukey (1960) (p. 448 ff.) Let x1, {$\cdots$}, xn be independent random variables with common distribution function F(t - {$\xi$}). The problem is to estimate the location parameter {$\xi$}, but with the complication that the prototype distribution F(t) is only approximately known. I shall primarily be concerned with the model of indeterminacy F = (1 - {$\epsilon$}){$\Phi$} + {$\epsilon$} H, where \$0 \textbackslash leqq \textbackslash epsilon {$<$} 1\$ is a known number, {$\Phi$}(t) = (2{$\pi$})-1/2 {$\int$}t -{$\infty$} exp(-1/2s2) ds is the standard normal cumulative and H is an unknown contaminating distribution. This model arises for instance if the observations are assumed to be normal with variance 1, but a fraction {$\epsilon$} of them is affected by gross errors. Later on, I shall also consider other models of indeterminacy, e.g., \$\textbackslash sup\_t |F(t) - \textbackslash Phi(t)| \textbackslash leqq \textbackslash epsilon\$. Some inconvenience is caused by the fact that location and scale parameters are not uniquely determined: in general, for fixed {$\epsilon$}, there will be several values of {$\xi$} and {$\sigma$} such that \$\textbackslash sup\_t|F(t) - \textbackslash Phi((t - \textbackslash xi)/\textbackslash sigma)| \textbackslash leqq \textbackslash epsilon\$, and similarly for the contaminated case. Although this inherent and unavoidable indeterminacy is small if {$\epsilon$} is small and is rather irrelevant for practical purposes, it poses awkward problems for the theory, especially for optimality questions. To remove this difficulty, one may either (i) restrict attention to symmetric distributions, and estimate the location of the center of symmetry (this works for {$\xi$} but not for {$\sigma$}); or (ii) one may define the parameter to be estimated in terms of the estimator itself, namely by its asymptotic value for sample size n \textrightarrow{} {$\infty$}; or (iii) one may define the parameters by arbitrarily chosen functionals of the distribution (e.g., by the expectation, or the median of F). All three possibilities have unsatisfactory aspects, and I shall usually choose the variant which is mathematically most convenient. It is interesting to look back to the very origin of the theory of estimation, namely to Gauss and his theory of least squares. Gauss was fully aware that his main reason for assuming an underlying normal distribution and a quadratic loss function was mathematical, i.e., computational, convenience. In later times, this was often forgotten, partly because of the central limit theorem. However, if one wants to be honest, the central limit theorem can at most explain why many distributions occurring in practice are approximately normal. The stress is on the word "approximately." This raises a question which could have been asked already by Gauss, but which was, as far as I know, only raised a few years ago (notably by Tukey): What happens if the true distribution deviates slightly from the assumed normal one? As is now well known, the sample mean then may have a catastrophically bad performance: seemingly quite mild deviations may already explode its variance. Tukey and others proposed several more robust substitutes--trimmed means, Winsorized means, etc.--and explored their performance for a few typical violations of normality. A general theory of robust estimation is still lacking; it is hoped that the present paper will furnish the first few steps toward such a theory. At the core of the method of least squares lies the idea to minimize the sum of the squared "errors," that is, to adjust the unknown parameters such that the sum of the squares of the differences between observed and computed values is minimized. In the simplest case, with which we are concerned here, namely the estimation of a location parameter, one has to minimize the expression {$\sum$}i (xi - T)2; this is of course achieved by the sample mean T = {$\sum$}i xi/n. I should like to emphasize that no loss function is involved here; I am only describing how the least squares estimator is defined, and neither the underlying family of distributions nor the true value of the parameter to be estimated enters so far. It is quite natural to ask whether one can obtain more robustness by minimizing another function of the errors than the sum of their squares. We shall therefore concentrate our attention to estimators that can be defined by a minimum principle of the form (for a location parameter): T = Tn(x1, {$\cdots$}, xn) minimizes {$\sum$}i {$\rho$}(xi - T), \textbackslash begin\{equation*\} \textbackslash tag\{M\} where \textbackslash rho is a non-constant function. \textbackslash end\{equation*\} Of course, this definition generalizes at once to more general least squares type problems, where several parameters have to be determined. This class of estimators contains in particular (i) the sample mean ({$\rho$}(t) = t2), (ii) the sample median ({$\rho$}(t) = |t|), and more generally, (iii) all maximum likelihood estimators ({$\rho$}(t) = -log f(t), where f is the assumed density of the untranslated distribution). These (M)-estimators, as I shall call them for short, have rather pleasant asymptotic properties; sufficient conditions for asymptotic normality and an explicit expression for their asymptotic variance will be given. How should one judge the robustness of an estimator Tn(x) = Tn(x1, {$\cdots$}, xn)? Since ill effects from contamination are mainly felt for large sample sizes, it seems that one should primarily optimize large sample robustness properties. Therefore, a convenient measure of robustness for asymptotically normal estimators seems to be the supremum of the asymptotic variance (n \textrightarrow{} {$\infty$}) when F ranges over some suitable set of underlying distributions, in particular over the set of all F = (1 - {$\epsilon$}){$\Phi$} + {$\epsilon$} H for fixed {$\epsilon$} and symmetric H. On second thought, it turns out that the asymptotic variance is not only easier to handle, but that even for moderate values of n it is a better measure of performance than the actual variance, because (i) the actual variance of an estimator depends very much on the behavior of the tails of H, and the supremum of the actual variance is infinite for any estimator whose value is always contained in the convex hull of the observations. (ii) If an estimator is asymptotically normal, then the important central part of its distribution and confidence intervals for moderate confidence levels can better be approximated in terms of the asymptotic variance than in terms of the actual variance. If we adopt this measure of robustness, and if we restrict attention to (M)-estimators, then it will be shown that the most robust estimator is uniquely determined and corresponds to the following {$\rho$}:{$\rho$}(t) = 1/2t2 for \$|t| {$<$} k, \textbackslash rho(t) = k|t| - \textbackslash frac\{1\}\{2\}k\^2\$ for |t| {$\geq$} k, with k depending on {$\epsilon$}. This estimator is most robust even among all translation invariant estimators. Sample mean (k = {$\infty$}) and sample median (k = 0) are limiting cases corresponding to {$\epsilon$} = 0 and {$\epsilon$} = 1, respectively, and the estimator is closely related and asymptotically equivalent to Winsorizing. I recall the definition of Winsorizing: assume that the observations have been ordered, x1 {$\leq$} x2 {$\leq$} {$\cdots$} {$\leq$} xn, then the statistic T = n-1(gxg + 1 + xg + 1 + xg + 2 + {$\cdots$} + xn - h + hxn - h) is called the Winsorized mean, obtained by Winsorizing the g leftmost and the h rightmost observations. The above most robust (M)-estimators can be described by the same formula, except that in the first and in the last summand, the factors xg + 1 and xn - h have to be replaced by some numbers u, v satisfying xg {$\leq$} u {$\leq$} xg + 1 and xn - h {$\leq$} v {$\leq$} xn - h + 1, respectively; g, h, u and v depend on the sample. In fact, this (M)-estimator is the maximum likelihood estimator corresponding to a unique least favorable distribution F0 with density f0(t) = (1 - {$\epsilon$})(2{$\pi$})-1/2e-{$\rho$}(t). This f0 behaves like a normal density for small t, like an exponential density for large t. At least for me, this was rather surprising--I would have expected an f0 with much heavier tails. This result is a particular case of a more general one that can be stated roughly as follows: Assume that F belongs to some convex set C of distribution functions. Then the most robust (M)-estimator for the set C coincides with the maximum likelihood estimator for the unique F0 {$\epsilon$} C which has the smallest Fisher information number I(F) = {$\int$} (f'/f)2f dt among all F {$\epsilon$} C. Miscellaneous related problems will also be treated: the case of non-symmetric contaminating distributions; the most robust estimator for the model of indeterminacy \$\textbackslash sup\_t|F(t) - \textbackslash Phi(t)| \textbackslash leqq \textbackslash epsilon\$; robust estimation of a scale parameter; how to estimate location, if scale and {$\epsilon$} are unknown; numerical computation of the estimators; more general estimators, e.g., minimizing \$\textbackslash sum\_\{i {$<$} j\} \textbackslash rho(x\_i - T, x\_j - T)\$, where {$\rho$} is a function of two arguments. Questions of small sample size theory will not be touched in this paper.}

  abstract = {We present the Open Graph Benchmark (OGB), a diverse set of challenging and realistic benchmark datasets to facilitate scalable, robust, and reproducible graph machine learning (ML) research. OGB datasets are large-scale, encompass multiple important graph ML tasks, and cover a diverse range of domains, ranging from social and information networks to biological networks, molecular graphs, source code ASTs, and knowledge graphs. For each dataset, we provide a unified evaluation protocol using meaningful application-specific data splits and evaluation metrics. In addition to building the datasets, we also perform extensive benchmark experiments for each dataset. Our experiments suggest that OGB datasets present significant challenges of scalability to large-scale graphs and out-of-distribution generalization under realistic data splits, indicating fruitful opportunities for future research. Finally, OGB provides an automated end-to-end graph ML pipeline that simplifies and standardizes the process of graph data loading, experimental setup, and model evaluation. OGB will be regularly updated and welcomes inputs from the community. OGB datasets as well as data loaders, evaluation scripts, baseline code, and leaderboards are publicly available at https://ogb.stanford.edu .},

Expectation maximization (EM), generalized expectation maximization (GEM), Fletcher-Powell, and Fisher-scoring algorithms are described for parameter estimation. It is shown how the machinery within a software that handles the complete data problem can be utilized to implement each algorithm. A numerical differentiation method for obtaining the observed information matrix and the standard errors is given. This method also uses the complete data program machinery. The likelihood ratio test is discussed for testing hypotheses. Three examples are used to compare the cost of the four algorithms mentioned above, as well as to illustrate the standard error estimation and the test of hypothesis considered. The sensitivity of the ML estimates as well as the mean imputed and listwise deletion estimates to missing data mechanisms is investigated using three artificial data sets that are missing completely at random (MCAR), missing at random (MAR), and neither MCAR nor MAR.},

For jointly Gaussian variables, this translates into detecting the support of the precision matrix. Many modern applications feature high-dimensional and contaminated data that complicate this task. In particular, traditional robust methods that down-weight entire observation vectors are often inappropriate as high-dimensional data may feature partial contamination in many observations. We tackle this problem by giving a robust method for sparse precision matrix estimation based on the \$\textbackslash gamma\$-divergence under a cell-wise contamination model. Simulation studies demonstrate that our procedure outperforms existing methods especially for highly contaminated data.},

The dynamics of the shape and the descriptive statistics of these trees are analyzed in various investment domains. The method provides evidence of regime changes in dependency structures prior to market sell-offs, and as such, it is a potential candidate for monitoring systemic risk.  We also provide empirical evidence that the assets that are located towards the center of the network tend to have higher returns.  Finally, an investment strategy that utilizes network centrality information is shown to add value historically.},

We show that the standard definition of eigenvector centrality is misleading when the adjacency matrix in a network can take negative values. This is, for example, the case when the network topology is induced by the correlation matrix between assets in a portfolio. To correct for this, we introduce the concept of positive and negative eigenvector centrality. Our results show that the loss function associated to the minimum variance portfolio is positively/negatively related to the positive and negative eigenvector centrality under short-selling constraints but cannot be generalized beyond that. Furthermore, in contrast to what is claimed in the related literature, this relationship does not imply any monotonic relationship between the centrality of an asset and its optimal portfolio allocation. These theoretical insights are illustrated empirically in a portfolio allocation exercise with assets from U.S. and U.K. financial markets.},

Szarek for constructing certain random Banach spaces. We give a new argument for estimating the metric entropy of some subsets such as the Grassmann manifold equipped with natural metrics. Here, the Grassmann manifold is thought of as the set of orthogonal projection of given rank.},

Our approach is score-based, and revolves around minimizing a penalized loss subject to an acyclicity constraint. To solve this problem, we leverage a recent algebraic result characterizing the acyclicity constraint as a smooth equality constraint. The resulting algorithm, which we call DYNOTEARS, outperforms other methods on simulated data, especially in high-dimensions as the number of variables increases. We also apply this algorithm on real datasets from two different domains, finance and molecular biology, and analyze the resulting output. Compared to state-of-the-art methods for learning dynamic Bayesian networks, our method is both scalable and accurate on real data. The simple formulation and competitive performance of our method make it suitable for a variety of problems where one seeks to learn connections between variables across time.},

One measure of robustness to such perturbations in the input is the Lipschitz constant of the input-output map defined by an NN. In this work, we propose a framework to train multi-layer NNs while at the same time encouraging robustness by keeping their Lipschitz constant small, thus addressing the robustness issue. More specifically, we design an optimization scheme based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers that minimizes not only the training loss of an NN but also its Lipschitz constant resulting in a semidefinite programming based training procedure that promotes robustness. We design two versions of this training procedure. The first one includes a regularizer that penalizes an accurate upper bound on the Lipschitz constant. The second one allows to enforce a desired Lipschitz bound on the NN at all times during training. Finally, we provide two examples to show that the proposed framework successfully increases the robustness of NNs.},

We close this gap by presenting a theoretical analysis of these approaches, hence explaining why they perform well in practice. More precisely, we make two new contributions. The first one relates the randomization rate to robustness to adversarial attacks. This result applies for the general family of exponential distributions, and thus extends and unifies the previous approaches. The second contribution consists in devising a new upper bound on the adversarial risk gap of randomized neural networks. We support our theoretical claims with a set of experiments.},

HRP applies modern mathematics (graph theory and machine-learning techniques) to build a diversified portfolio based on the information contained in the covariance matrix. However, unlike quadratic optimizers, HRP does not require the invertibility of the covariance matrix. In fact, HRP can compute a portfolio on an ill-degenerated or even a singular covariance matrix\textemdash an impossible feat for quadratic optimizers. Monte Carlo experiments show that HRP delivers lower out-ofsample variance than CLA, even though minimum variance is CLA's optimization objective. HRP also produces less risky portfolios out of sample compared to traditional risk parity methods. TOPICS: Statistical methods, portfolio construction},

This problem can be considered a homogeneous variant of the sparse recovery problem, and finds connections to sparse dictionary learning, sparse PCA, and many other problems in signal processing and machine learning. In this paper, we focus on a **planted sparse model** for the subspace: the target sparse vector is embedded in an otherwise random subspace. Simple convex heuristics for this planted recovery problem provably break down when the fraction of nonzero entries in the target sparse vector substantially exceeds \$O(1/\textbackslash sqrt\{n\})\$. In contrast, we exhibit a relatively simple nonconvex approach based on alternating directions, which provably succeeds even when the fraction of nonzero entries is \$\textbackslash Omega(1)\$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first practical algorithm to achieve linear scaling under the planted sparse model. Empirically, our proposed algorithm also succeeds in more challenging data models, e.g., sparse dictionary learning.},

Unfortunately the product moment covariance and the corresponding Pearson correlation are very susceptible to outliers (anomalies) in the data. Several robust measures of covariance have been developed, but few are suitable for the ultrahigh dimensional data that are becoming more prevalent nowadays. For that one needs methods whose computation scales well with the dimension, are guaranteed to yield a positive semidefinite covariance matrix, and are sufficiently robust to outliers as well as sufficiently accurate in the statistical sense of low variability. We construct such methods using data transformations. The resulting approach is simple, fast and widely applicable. We study its robustness by deriving influence functions and breakdown values, and computing the mean squared error on contaminated data. Using these results we select a method that performs well overall. This also allows us to construct a faster version of the DetectDeviatingCells method (Rousseeuw and Van den Bossche, 2018) to detect cellwise outliers, that can deal with much higher dimensions. The approach is illustrated on genomic data with 12,000 variables and color video data with 920,000 dimensions.},

Depending on the situation, outliers may be (a) undesirable errors which can adversely affect the data analysis, or (b) valuable nuggets of unexpected information. In statistics and data analysis the word outlier usually refers to a row of the data matrix, and the methods to detect such outliers only work when at least half the rows are clean. But often many rows have a few contaminated cell values, which may not be visible by looking at each variable (column) separately. We propose the first method to detect deviating data cells in a multivariate sample which takes the correlations between the variables into account. It has no restriction on the number of clean rows, and can deal with high dimensions. Other advantages are that it provides estimates of the `expected' values of the outlying cells, while imputing missing values at the same time. We illustrate the method on several real data sets, where it uncovers more structure than found by purely columnwise methods or purely rowwise methods. The proposed method can help to diagnose why a certain row is outlying, e.g. in process control. It may also serve as an initial step for estimating multivariate location and scatter matrices.},

Finally, we adopt the adaptive Lasso to obtain variable selection results. The proposed approach is robust to cellwise outliers in regular and high dimensional settings and empirical results show good performance in comparison with recently proposed alternative robust approaches, particularly in the challenging setting when contamination rates are high but the magnitude of outliers is moderate.

Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train.

We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

  abstract = {Deep neural networks are notorious for being sensitive to small well-chosen perturbations, and estimating the regularity of such architectures is of utmost importance for safe and robust practical applications. In this paper, we investigate one of the key characteristics to assess the regularity of such methods: the Lipschitz constant of deep learning architectures. First, we show that, even for two layer neural networks, the exact computation of this quantity is NP-hard and state-ofart methods may significantly overestimate it. Then, we both extend and improve previous estimation methods by providing AutoLip, the first generic algorithm for upper bounding the Lipschitz constant of any automatically differentiable function. We provide a power method algorithm working with automatic differentiation, allowing efficient computations even on large convolutions. Second, for sequential neural networks, we propose an improved algorithm named SeqLip that takes advantage of the linear computation graph to split the computation per pair of consecutive layers. Third we propose heuristics on SeqLip in order to tackle very large networks. Our experiments show that SeqLip can significantly improve on the existing upper bounds. Finally, we provide an implementation of AutoLip in the PyTorch environment that may be used to better estimate the robustness of a given neural network to small perturbations or regularize it using more precise Lipschitz estimations.},

To improve risk-return characteristics of well-known return maximization and risk minimization benchmark portfolios, we propose simple adjustments to portfolio selection strategies that utilize centralization measures from financial networks. From a sample of 45 assets (stock market indices, bond and money market instruments, commodities, and foreign exchange rates) and from data for 1999 to 2015, we show that irrespective of the network and centrality employed, the proposed network-based asset allocation strategies improve key portfolio return characteristics in an out-of-sample framework, most notably, risk and left-tail risk-adjusted returns. Resolving portfolio model selection uncertainties further improves risk-return characteristics. Improvements made to portfolio strategies based on risk minimization are also robust to transaction costs.},

PCA can help to improve the predictive performance of machine learning methods while reducing the redundancy among the data. Experiments are carried out on a high dimensional spectral of 3 stock exchanges such as: New York Stock Exchange, London Stock Exchange and Karachi Stock Exchange. The accuracy of linear regression classification model is compared before and after applying PCA. The experiments show that PCA can improve the performance of machine learning in general if and only if relative correlation among input features is investigated and careful selection is done while choosing principal components. Root mean square error (RMSE) is used as an evaluation metric to evaluate the classification model.},

From this new perspective, we propose the graphical normalizing flow, a new invertible transformation with either a prescribed or a learnable graphical structure. This model provides a promising way to inject domain knowledge into normalizing flows while preserving both the interpretability of Bayesian networks and the representation capacity of normalizing flows. We show that graphical conditioners discover relevant graph structure when we cannot hypothesize it. In addition, we analyze the effect of \$\textbackslash ell\_1\$-penalization on the recovered structure and on the quality of the resulting density estimation. Finally, we show that graphical conditioners lead to competitive white box density estimators. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/AWehenkel/DAG-NF.},

  abstract = {The complexity and opacity of the network of interconnections among firms and their supply chains inhibits understanding of the impact of management decisions concerning the boundaries of the firm and the number and intensity of its relationships with suppliers and customers. Using recently available data on the relationships of public US firms, this paper investigates the effects of supply chain connections on firm performance as reflected in stock returns. The paper finds that supply chain structure is closely related to firm returns at two levels, a first-order effect from direct connections and a second-order impact from systemic exposures through the network. For the first order effect, using a cross-sectional data set of the supply chain network and monthly returns, we show that a firm's return can be explained by its concurrent supplier returns, concurrent customer returns, own momentum, and supplier momentum, whereas customer momentum has little impact. A long-short equity strategy based on the supplier momentum yields monthly abnormal returns of 56 basis points. This result implies investors' limited attention to supplier firms relative to customer firms and gradual diffusion of information downstream as opposed to upstream in the supply chain. For the second-order effect, we find a market anomaly by grouping firms according to their centrality in the supply chain. Specifically, manufacturing firms that are more central in the network earn lower returns, while logistics firms that are more central in the network earn higher returns. This result holds for both eigenvector centrality and in-degree centrality (number of suppliers). We argue that centrality and multiplicity of suppliers have different risk implications for firms operating in different industries. More central firms in manufacturing choose their suppliers to operationally hedge shocks transmitted from other firms and earn lower returns due to lower systematic risk. On the contrary, more central firms in logistics are shock aggregators, earning higher returns due to their exposure to greater systematic risk. Our results are robust after controlling for common asset pricing factors.},

Deep learning provides us with powerful tools to build predictive models that are appropriate for the rising amounts of data, but the gap between what these neural networks learn and what human beings can comprehend is growing. Moreover, this gap may induce distrust and restrict deep learning applications in practice. Here, we introduce a new graph neural network architecture called Attentive FP for molecular representation that uses a graph attention mechanism to learn from relevant drug discovery data sets. We demonstrate that Attentive FP achieves state-of-the-art predictive performances on a variety of data sets and that what it learns is interpretable. The feature visualization for Attentive FP suggests that it automatically learns nonlocal intramolecular interactions from specified tasks, which can help us gain chemical insights directly from data beyond human perception.}

Streaming principal component analysis aims to find the \$k\$-dimensional subspace which can explain the most variation of the \$d\$-dimensional data points that come into memory sequentially. In order to deal with large \$d\$ and large \$N\$ (number of samples), most streaming PCA algorithms update the current model using only the incoming sample and then dump the information right away to save memory. However the information contained in previously streamed data could be useful. Motivated by this idea, we develop a new streaming PCA algorithm called History PCA that achieves this goal. By using \$O(Bd)\$ memory with \$B\textbackslash approx 10\$ being the block size, our algorithm converges much faster than existing streaming PCA algorithms. By changing the number of inner iterations, the memory usage can be further reduced to \$O(d)\$ while maintaining a comparable convergence speed. We provide theoretical guarantees for the convergence of our algorithm along with the rate of convergence. We also demonstrate on synthetic and real world data sets that our algorithm compares favorably with other state-of-the-art streaming PCA methods in terms of the convergence speed and performance.},

We also provide an \$\textbackslash Omega(T\textbackslash sqrt\{kN\} + \textbackslash sqrt\{dkNT\})\$ regret lower bound, showing that our algorithm is minimax-optimal up to poly-logarithmic factors. Furthermore, we extend our algorithm to the infinite-action setting and obtain a corresponding regret bound which demonstrates the benefit of representation learning in certain regimes. We also present experiments on synthetic and real-world data to illustrate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms.},
